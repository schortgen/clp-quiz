Q\ What is "sloshing" in a tanker?
O\ The sound the liquid makes
O\ The movement of liquid in a partially filled tank
O\ A type of leak
A\ The movement of liquid in a partially filled tank
E\ Sloshing, or surge, is the wave-like motion of liquid that can push the truck and affect handling.

Q\ How does sloshing affect the handling of a tanker?
O\ It can push the truck forward or sideways
O\ It improves traction
O\ It has no effect
A\ It can push the truck forward or sideways
E\ The force of the moving liquid can be strong enough to affect braking, accelerating, and turning.

Q\ What is an "outage" in a tanker?
O\ A power failure in the truck
O\ The empty space left in a tank to allow for liquid expansion
O\ A leak from the top of the tank
A\ The empty space left in a tank to allow for liquid expansion
E\ Liquids expand when they get warm. Leaving room for this expansion (outage) prevents ruptures and spills.

Q\ What is the purpose of baffles in a tanker?
O\ To separate different types of liquid
O\ To reduce the sloshing of the liquid
O\ To strengthen the tank
A\ To reduce the sloshing of the liquid
E\ Baffles are dividers with holes in them inside the tank that slow down the back-and-forth motion of the liquid.

Q\ A smooth bore tanker (one without baffles) is most likely to be used for:
O\ Hauling milk or other food products
O\ Hauling gasoline
O\ Hauling water
A\ Hauling milk or other food products
E\ Smooth bore tanks are easier to clean and sanitize, which is a requirement for food-grade liquids.

Q\ Which type of tanker has the biggest problem with surge?
O\ A baffled tanker
O\ A tanker with multiple compartments
O\ A smooth bore tanker
A\ A smooth bore tanker
E\ With no baffles to slow the liquid down, the full force of the surge is felt by the driver.

Q\ When driving a tanker, you should increase your following distance because:
O\ The high center of gravity requires more stopping distance
O\ Brake lag is longer in tankers
O\ The surge effect can push you forward when you stop
A\ The surge effect can push you forward when you stop
E\ Even after you stop, the liquid can surge forward, pushing the truck into the vehicle in front of you.

Q\ What is the biggest danger when driving a tanker through a curve?
O\ Engine failure
O\ Rollover
O\ Brake fade
A\ Rollover
E\ Tankers have a high center of gravity, and the outward push of the liquid in a curve greatly increases the risk of a rollover.

Q\ To prevent rolling over in a curve, you should:
O\ Slow down to a safe speed before entering the curve
O\ Brake hard while in the curve
O\ Accelerate through the curve
A\ Slow down to a safe speed before entering the curve
E\ You must reduce your speed before the turn. Braking in the turn can cause a loss of traction.

Q\ When loading a tanker with a single compartment, you should:
O\ Fill it completely to the top
O\ Keep it either very full or very empty
O\ Fill it exactly half full
A\ Keep it either very full or very empty
E\ A partially filled tank allows for the most liquid movement (surge). Full or empty tanks are the most stable.

Q\ What should you check during a pre-trip inspection of a tanker?
O\ The tank for leaks
O\ The valves and pipes
O\ All of the above
A\ All of the above
E\ A tanker inspection includes all standard truck components plus a thorough check of the tank, vents, piping, and valves.

Q\ When unloading a tanker, it is important to:
O\ Have good ventilation
O\ Ensure the emergency shut-off systems are working
O\ Both of the above
A\ Both of the above
E\ Safety during loading and unloading is critical, especially with flammable or toxic liquids.

Q\ A tanker endorsement is required on your CDL if you are hauling:
O\ Any liquid in a tank
O\ More than 119 gallons of liquid in a portable tank
O\ A permanently attached tank with a capacity of 1,000 gallons or more
A\ A permanently attached tank with a capacity of 1,000 gallons or more
E\ The N endorsement is for vehicles with large, permanently attached tanks.

Q\ How do you brake with a tanker?
O\ Brake later and harder than with other trucks
O\ Brake earlier and more gently than with other trucks
O\ Pump the brakes
A\ Brake earlier and more gently than with other trucks
E\ Smooth, early braking helps control the surge and prevents the wheels from locking up.

Q\ Bulkheads are:
O\ Solid dividers inside a tank
O\ Another name for baffles
O\ The end caps of the tank
A\ Solid dividers inside a tank
E\ Bulkheads create separate, smaller tanks (compartments) within the main tank. They are solid and do not let liquid pass through.

Q\ A tank with bulkheads will experience:
O\ More surge than a smooth bore tank
O\ Less surge than a baffled tank
O\ Less surge than a smooth bore tank
A\ Less surge than a smooth bore tank
E\ Because the liquid is contained in smaller compartments, the surge is less pronounced.

Q\ When accelerating a tanker, you should:
O\ Accelerate quickly to get up to speed
O\ Accelerate smoothly and gradually
O\ It does not matter
A\ Accelerate smoothly and gradually
E\ Smooth acceleration prevents the liquid from surging to the back and causing handling problems.

Q\ What is the purpose of a vapor recovery system?
O\ To prevent liquid from spilling
O\ To capture flammable vapors and prevent them from escaping into the air
O\ To cool the liquid in the tank
A\ To capture flammable vapors and prevent them from escaping into the air
E\ This is an environmental and safety feature used when loading and unloading flammable liquids like gasoline.

Q\ When pulling a tanker, you should be extra cautious when driving on:
O\ Wet or icy roads
O\ Steep hills
O\ Both of the above
A\ Both of the above
E\ The high center of gravity and the effects of surge make tankers particularly challenging to handle in adverse conditions.

Q\ The person in charge of loading and unloading a tanker is responsible for:
O\ Knowing what the product is
O\ Ensuring the valves are set correctly
O\ Both of the above
A\ Both of the above
E\ Proper procedures must be followed to prevent spills, mixing of incompatible products, and other accidents.
