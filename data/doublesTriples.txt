Q\ When pulling more than one trailer, which trailer should be first behind the tractor?
O\ The heaviest trailer
O\ The lightest trailer
O\ The longest trailer
A\ The heaviest trailer
E\ Placing the heaviest trailer in the lead position provides the most stability and helps prevent the "crack-the-whip" effect.

Q\ What is a converter dolly?
O\ A tool for converting tire sizes
O\ A coupling device used to connect a semi-trailer to another trailer
O\ A type of hand truck
A\ A coupling device used to connect a semi-trailer to another trailer
E\ A converter dolly has a fifth wheel, axles, and an air supply system, allowing a second or third trailer to be attached.

Q\ You are driving a 100-foot vehicle with double trailers at 50 mph. The road is dry. You need at least ___ seconds of following distance.
O\ 8
O\ 10
O\ 11
A\ 11
E\ The formula is 1 second per 10 feet of vehicle length, plus 1 extra second for speeds over 40 mph. 100 feet = 10 seconds, +1 second for speed = 11 seconds.

Q\ What is the "crack-the-whip" effect most likely to cause?
O\ Engine failure
O\ A rollover of the rear trailer
O\ Brake fade
A\ A rollover of the rear trailer
E\ The rearward amplification of a sudden steering movement can cause the last trailer to swing violently and roll over.

Q\ When inspecting a set of doubles, you should check that:
O\ The shut-off valves on the rear of the trailers are open
O\ The converter dolly air tank is drained
O\ Both of the above
A\ Both of the above
E\ A full inspection includes checking all air lines, valves, and draining all air tanks, including the one on the dolly.

Q\ To uncouple the rear trailer in a set of doubles, you should first:
O\ Lower the landing gear on the rear trailer
O\ Disconnect the air lines to the rear trailer
O\ Position the rig in a straight line on level ground
A\ Position the rig in a straight line on level ground
E\ Proper positioning is the first and most critical step for safe uncoupling.

Q\ When are you most likely to lose traction when pulling doubles?
O\ On a straight, flat road
O\ When making a quick lane change
O\ When starting from a stop
A\ When making a quick lane change
E\ Sudden or sharp movements can easily lead to skids or rollovers due to the crack-the-whip effect.

Q\ Before you can pull double or triple trailers, you must:
O\ Have a special endorsement on your CDL
O\ Have at least 5 years of driving experience
O\ Pass a special physical exam
A\ Have a special endorsement on your CDL
E\ The "T" endorsement is required on a CDL to legally operate a vehicle pulling double or triple trailers.

Q\ When coupling a converter dolly to a trailer, you should:
O\ Make sure the trailer height is slightly lower than the dolly's fifth wheel
O\ Release the dolly brake and roll it under the trailer by hand
O\ Both of the above
A\ Both of the above
E\ The trailer should be slightly lower so the dolly can roll under, and it's often necessary to position the dolly manually.

Q\ The shut-off valves on the rear of the front trailer should be:
O\ Open
O\ Closed
O\ It does not matter
A\ Open
E\ The valves must be open to supply air to the brakes on the rear trailer(s).

Q\ The shut-off valves on the very last trailer should be:
O\ Open
O\ Closed
O\ Removed
A\ Closed
E\ Closing the valves on the last trailer prevents air from escaping the system.

Q\ How do you check that the trailer brakes are working on a set of doubles?
O\ Apply the trailer hand brake and listen for the brakes to come on
O\ Gently pull forward with the hand brake applied
O\ Both of the above
A\ Both of the above
E\ You should both listen for the sound of the air applying the brakes and perform a gentle tug test.

Q\ Driving a triple trailer combination is:
O\ Allowed in all states
O\ Not allowed in any state
O\ Only allowed in certain states and on specific highways
A\ Only allowed in certain states and on specific highways
E\ The legality of triple trailers varies by state and is often restricted to designated routes.

Q\ What is the best way to prevent skids with double and triple trailers?
O\ Steer gently and smoothly
O\ Brake hard in turns
O\ Drive faster than the flow of traffic
A\ Steer gently and smoothly
E\ Smooth, gradual steering is essential to prevent rearward amplification and maintain stability.

Q\ When turning with long combination vehicles, you should:
O\ Turn as you would with a single trailer
O\ Swing out as wide as possible
O\ Be aware of off-tracking and the path of the last trailer
A\ Be aware of off-tracking and the path of the last trailer
E\ You must have a complete picture of where all your trailers are to safely navigate turns.

Q\ If you have to make a sudden move to avoid a hazard, you should know that:
O\ The rear trailer will move the most
O\ The front trailer will move the most
O\ All trailers will move equally
A\ The rear trailer will move the most
E\ The crack-the-whip effect means the last trailer will swing out much more than the tractor or the first trailer.

Q\ What is a "pintle hook"?
O\ A type of fifth wheel
O\ A coupling device used to connect a converter dolly to a trailer
O\ A tool for inspecting tires
A\ A coupling device used to connect a converter dolly to a trailer
E\ A pintle hook on the rear of a trailer is used to tow a converter dolly for the next trailer.

Q\ When inspecting the pintle hook connection, you should ensure that:
O\ The safety latch is in place
O\ It is properly greased
O\ Both of the above
A\ Both of the above
E\ The pintle hook must be securely latched and properly lubricated for safe operation.

Q\ What is the main danger of pulling a light trailer behind a heavy one?
O\ The light trailer is more likely to flip over
O\ It increases the risk of the "crack-the-whip" effect
O\ It puts too much strain on the tractor
A\ It increases the risk of the "crack-the-whip" effect
E\ A light rear trailer is more susceptible to being whipped around by the heavier lead trailer, increasing the risk of a rollover.

Q\ When pulling doubles or triples, you should look:
O\ Much farther ahead than you would with a single trailer
O\ Mostly in your side mirrors
O\ Directly in front of your truck
A\ Much farther ahead than you would with a single trailer
E\ Because it takes longer to stop and maneuver, you need to see hazards much earlier to have enough time to react safely.
